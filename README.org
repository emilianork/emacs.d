* EmilianoRK Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my Emacs configuration. It was originally written and
documented using literate programming style. I have rewritten it with elisp.

If you want to see a literate programmy style configuration I hightly recommend
you to go [[https://github.com/munen/emacs.d][here]].
